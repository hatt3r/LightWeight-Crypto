## Overview

**Prototype-LightWeight-Cryptography** is a repository containing the prototype for the technical report which compares the CPU usage and memory usage of the three hybrid encryption methods
AES-ECC-EAX mode, RSA-ECC-EAX mode, AES-ECC-GCM mode.
this also contains the profiler program to calculate the CPU processing time and memory usage

## Contents

- **AES-ECC-EAX hybrid encryption python file** 
- **RSA-ECC-EAX hybrid encryption python file**
- **AES-ECC-GCM hybrid encryption python file**
- **CPU and memory Profiler python file**

## code help

- [Main codes](https://github.com/xbeat/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Cryptography%20with%20Python%20Essentials.md)
- [Time module](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/time)
- [memory profiling](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/)
- [how to get time of python execution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557571/how-do-i-get-time-of-a-python-programs-execution)

## Execution

To execute the python files :

```bash
python3 <file-name>.py
```

to execute the main CPU profiler and memory:

```bash
python3 CPUProfile.py
```

some of the files have to import modules from the folder or pip installing them

we also have attached the technical report for this project
